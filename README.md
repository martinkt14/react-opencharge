# React OpenCharge App

This project utilizes the [Open Charge Map API](https://openchargemap.org/site/develop/api) in conjunction with [Mapbox GL JS](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/) to display the location of public electric/hybrid vehicle charging stations.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Design

To bootstrap this application quickly and to incorporate current design standards that users are used to, [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) was used to help with the layout.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
